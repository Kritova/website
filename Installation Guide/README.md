# Developer Setup Guide

## 1. Install Node.js (LTS Version)

1. Download the **LTS** version of Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
2. Run the installer.
3. Make sure to select **“Add to PATH”** (or a similar option) during the installation so `node` and `npm` commands are recognized.
4. Once installed, open a **new** terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt) and verify:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v

You should see version numbers for both node and npm.


## 2. Install Git (If Needed)
- Download Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads.

- During setup, choose default options or configure as you wish.

- Verify installation in a new terminal:

```bash
